# Anxiety buddy
I have been dealing with anxiety attacks and panic attacks most of my life. Many of my friends as experienced a panic- and/or anxiety attack at least once in their life. What happens then is that your minds imagination creates a scenario where you think you're in danger, but you're actually just get mental blocking, difficult breathing and paralysing motorskills. 

It can be difficult to calm yourself down from the attack, that's why I created this online informational assistant to help and guide you. Over the years I've gotten through anxiety attacks much better once I've had a person to talk to. So my idea is that Anxiety Buddy is a virtual assistant that can help you through anxiety attacks when you can't get hold of anyone to talk to.

Anxiety buddy is a online informational tool that's meant to calm you down by giving you the helpful information, online, when you're having an anxiety attack.

Responsive Mockup

The goal is to develop an online tool that works like a digital buddy.

# The Contact Page
This page gives the user the option to contact us if they need to. Either to get mor information, add additional value to our site or just reach out because they're not well. Anxiety buddy has as an ambition to reduce mental illness and improve mental health. The user will submit their email and name, after that we can respond to them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

# Features Left to Implement
The thought is to add videos, more instructive images, to add to the value that Anxiety Buddy gives the user. We want this to be another page that can asists you and even interact with the user so that the user gets good information, help and assistance to increase their mental health wellness.

# Testing
Building this site has taken a lot of effort. I am a student working really hard against tight deadlines and I'm very happy with I've done so far with Anxiety Buddy. Allthough I am not completely happy with the outcome, I've moved around the CSS and HTML enough to be sure that this is as good as it gets. The Anxiety buddy page is a work in progress and muy ambition is to get it to work as an interactive buddy. Over the years I've gotten through anxiety attacks much better once I've had a person to talk to. So my idea is that Anxiety Buddy is a virtual assistant that can help you through anxiety attacks when you can't get hold of anyone to talk to.

# Visuals
The visual and functional parts are there, allthough it's not working quite as intended. My testing has been thorough. I have a hyperlink on the website to the main page of World Helath Organisations website, for more thorough information. 

## Accessibility
You can access the Anxiety Buddy website both on a desktop, tablet or smartphone and the website will be somewhat responive. The page adapts to width and length of the page to better suit the user. The website also works in both Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari, and I've done several test with Anxiety Buddy and it works on both an Android smartphone and iPhone. 

I have discovered that the checkbox doesn't go away though I've followed the instructions in Love Running instructional videos. I have tried several times and doesn't get why it persists. 
Another issue is that I don't manage to get the text of the website to place itself on the picture I've chosen as a background, which is very annoying. So the text keeps put in the lower bottom of the page. 

Validator Testing
HTML
No problems have occurred
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

## Unfixed bugs
The checkbox in the header keeps me humble, I can not get it to go away without removing my entire menu and page bar.
Responsivity, I would like for the page to be more repsonsive than it is. I can access the landing page when i switch to mobile view, but I don't have the time to fix it now. 

# Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

(The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Credits
I got some great help from my mentor Moritz. ChatGPT has also been a great tool to have, because sometimes I need to have specific stuff explained or defined to understand the functionality of it.

# Thoughts on the project
I have been going through a quite rough patch personally due to depression. I am not happy with the responsivness of the page but I am very happy about pulling through and making something that I haven't done before. I see this as a great starting point and I'm very excited about hte next following proejcts from Code Institute, as well as feeling better personally.
Thank you.
