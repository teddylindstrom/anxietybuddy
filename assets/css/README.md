Anxiety buddy
I have been dealing with anxiety attacks and panic attacks most of my life. Many of my friends as experienced a panic- and/or anxiety attack at least once in their life. What happens then is that your minds imagination creates a scenario where you think you're in danger, but you're actually just get mental blocking, difficult breathing and paralysing motorskills. It can be difficult to calm yourself down from the attack, that's why I created this online informational assistant to help and guide you. Over the years I've gotten through anxiety attacks much better once I've had a person to talk to. So my idea is that Anxiety Buddy is a virtual assistant that can help you through anxiety attacks when you can't get hold of anyone to talk to.

Anxiety buddy is a online informational tool that's meant to calm you down by giving you the helpful information, online, when you're having an anxiety attack.

Anxiety buddy has as an ambition to reduce mental illness and improve mental health. The user will submit their email and name, after that we can respond to them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
The thought is to add videos, more instructive images, to add to the value that Anxiety Buddy gives the user. We want this to be another page that can asists you and even interact with the user so that the user gets good information, help and assistance to increase their mental health wellness.

Testing
Building this site has taken a lot of effort. I am a student working really hard against tight deadlines and I'm very happy with I've done so far with Anxiety Buddy. Allthough I am not completely happy with the outcome, I've moved around the CSS and HTML enough to be sure that this is as good as it gets. The Anxiety buddy page is a work in progress and muy ambition is to get it to work as an interactive buddy. Over the years I've gotten through anxiety attacks much better once I've had a person to talk to. So my idea is that Anxiety Buddy is a virtual assistant that can help you through anxiety attacks when you can't get hold of anyone to talk to.
The visual and functional parts are there, allthough it's not working quite as intended. My testing has been thorough. I have a hyperlink on the website to the main page of World Helath Organisations website, for more thorough information. 

You can access the Anxiety Buddy website both on a desktop, tablet or smartphone and the website will be responsive. The page adapts to width and length of the page to better suit the user. The website also works in both Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari, and I've done several test with Anxiety Buddy and it works on both an Android smartphone and iPhone. 

I have discovered that the checkbox doesn't go away though I've followed the instructions in Love Running instructional videos. I have tried several times and doesn't get why it persists. 
Another issue is that I don't manage to get the text of the website to place itself on the picture I've chosen as a background, which is very annoying. So the text keeps put in the lower bottom of the page. 

Validator Testing
HTML
I have three consisting problems that continue to appear. They a displayed under Problems while running the code in Gitpod. I haven't gotten the oppurtunity to solve that. 
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
